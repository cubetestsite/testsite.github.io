                        fees and costs of such action, in addition to any other relief granted to EPIC. You agree that EPIC will not be
                        liable to you or to any third party for termination of your access to the Site as a result of any violation of these

                    <p class="text-white font-regular font-12 ">You agree that all matters relating to your access to or use of the Site,
                        including all disputes, will be governed by the laws of the United States and by the laws of the State of California
                        without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions. You agree to the personal jurisdiction by and venue in the state
                        and federal courts in Los Angeles County, California, and waive any objection to such jurisdiction or venue. Any
                        claim under these Terms of Use must be brought within one (1) year after the cause of action arises, or such claim
                        or cause of action is barred. No recovery may be sought or received for damages other than out-of-pocket expenses,
                        except that the prevailing party will be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees. In the event of any controversy or
                        dispute between EPIC and you arising out of or in connection with your use of the Site, the parties shall attempt,
                        promptly and in good faith, to resolve any such dispute. If we are unable to resolve any such dispute within a
                        reasonable time (not to exceed thirty (30) days), then either party may submit such controversy or dispute to
                        mediation. If the dispute cannot be resolved through mediation, then the parties shall be free to pursue any right
                        or remedy available to them under applicable law.</p>

                        United States. Although the Site is accessible worldwide, not all features, products or services discussed,
                        referenced, provided or offered through or on the Site are available to all persons or in all geographic locations,
                        or appropriate or available for use outside the United States. EPIC reserves the right to limit, in its sole

                        the minimum extent necessary and replaced with a valid provision that best embodies the intent of these Terms of
                        Use, so that these Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect. These Terms of Use constitute the entire

                        categorically rejected. EPIC’s failure to insist on or enforce strict performance of these Terms of Use shall not be
                        construed as a waiver by EPIC of any provision or any right it has to enforce these Terms of Use, nor shall any
                        course of conduct between EPIC and you or any other party be deemed to modify any provision of these Terms of Use.
                        These Terms of Use shall not be interpreted or construed to confer any rights or remedies on any third parties.</p>
